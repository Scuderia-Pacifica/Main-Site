			<h1>
				Damian Lopez Drivers summary </h1>
			<b1 style="text-transform: uppercase;">
				My racing career started way before I got behind the wheel in the summer of
				2019. It started when I was three, when I first watched cars, and from what I heard i was truly
				captivated by the cars themselves and from there on I lost myself in the family tradition of cars. Fast
				forward to when I started racing karts was because, the final push ended up being drive to survive on
				Netflix, which is a show about the background of formula 1. That summer I went out to pgp to do the
				junior driver test and I passed and after about a year of practice I went to pro-am in my first season
				Finished 4th in the championship and the following one I won the championship by ten points after a
				season long battle with the runner up and now I am driving in the pro category and hope to make my mark
				in 206 series in karting with this new team DAT Motorsports.
				there you go
